# Script by Gill
## Script for checking status
I have written a script to check if the exam setup has begun for perticular koala or not. 

you can use this script as below. 
1. Download the script in your local
2. run the script as sh alert.sh ( koala number ). < sh alert.sh 2121 > 
3. It has some limitation like it will not give you the output of show-phase-state of examserver. 
3. It is designed to list the vms after the setup has started.
