## Script for checking status

I have written a script to check if the exam setup has begun for perticular koala or not. 

you can use this script as below. 
1. Download the script in your local system.
2. Edit the kproxy username to your username. 
3. Run the script as #sh alert.sh ( koala number ). < sh alert.sh 2121 > 
4. It is designed to list the vms after the setup has started.
5. It is display and show the current state of exam setup and the output of show-phase-state of examserver.
